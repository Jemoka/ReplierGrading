# Grade my replier plz :)
Hello there human ðŸ‘‹, please help me grade Replier! 

Basically, [replier](https://github.com/Jemoka/Replier) is a natural language generation project by myself trying to do psycological counseling with automated transformer sequence-to-sequence training with help from @exr0n and @klintkanopka.

And... Like most seq2seq tasks, human evaluation is need.

So, if you would like to be a human evaulator

1. please install python and create a venv
2. install everything in `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. edit the `REVIEWER` variable atop of `talkback.py` to your name
4. run `talkback.py` and follow any instructions

Please do as many of these as you like. Once you are done, please send `final_result.csv` or whatever you set your `RESULT` variable to be to me over Discord or email (`hliu@shabang.cf`). Thanks much.
